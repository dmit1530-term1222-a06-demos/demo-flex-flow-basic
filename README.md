# Demo | Flex-Flow Basic

This labs goes over the use of `flex-flow` property, which is the shorthand for `flex-direction` and `flex-wrap`. 

The `flex-flow` property can acccept either one or two values:
- flex-direction [row, column, row-reverse, column-reverse]
- flex-wrap [wrap, nowrap, wrap-reverse]

*the order the values doesn't matter*
